# Think about what can I make with this

When I read the tutorial, I think about what I make and read it.
Reading a tutorial looks like any other programmer. If there is a difference, read the following program to be read in mind. So if you want to be able to write the program at this point, stop at that point and start coding. After confirming the completion, I return to the previous place and continue reading. In this case, keep in mind the next target program.

This is called Active Reading, and it has been shown that this active reading is effective through various studies of education, when it comes to how to read with specific questions or purposes in reading. S is doing an active reading.

Note that the program S is often used as a first goal is called a word count program. This is a problem in the classic C programming language known as K & R or White Book. The problem is that you can read standard input, the number of words, and the number of characters to standard output.

If you read this article with this in mind, how do I loop in this language, how do I read one of the letters, and how do I print it? I will read the same questions positively. Also, you can easily feel the linguistic difference by writing the same program in multiple languages.

Read standard library source code when studying
Unlike natural language education, programming language education emphasizes writing more than reading relatively. It is very rare to do reading lessons when teaching a programming language. But in practice, it overwhelms the time programmers spend reading code. It is good code to read good code.

S has read the tutorial and has been reading and reading the language library for a while.

A standard library is usually written by the language inventor himself or at least by a few people who follow that style. It is the bundle of the most linguistic codes. Code that is written in the Java language but is no different from code written in the C language is also possible. The real criterion for separating programs written in Java and C is not what the keyword of the language is used for, but what style it is and what idioms are used.

S knows that it is not enough to learn the idioms, patterns, and styles of the language just by studying a tutorial.

I need to add functionality to someone else's code while studying
As you read the tutorial, S seems to create a practical example of something yourself. In the tutorial, it is easy to get relatively toy code, and this way you learn the sense of real code (reading and writing).

At that time, I was told that SSH clients had certain features and wishes. So I found an open source SSH client implemented in the language I was studying, read the code, and added new features (similar to the standard library reading earlier).

What is even more impressive is that from the time I started studying the language for the first time, it took me less than a few days to add the functionality I needed to the program I completed. The important point here is that I was able to come up with a small, simple add-on that you can create at that time.

In this way, I was actually able to get feedback from what I understood through the text.
